I got invited by Google directly while I was learning Python, SQL, Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. So I am not sure which one of them caused them to invite me!<br>
These codes were written in Python by me, and unfortunately I did not saved the first level codes and there is no way to go back to your codes.<br>
Please feel free if you need an invitation, as my invitation code is not used yet.<br>
